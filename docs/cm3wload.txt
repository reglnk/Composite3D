The file describes how the World is loaded and saved.

All features:

1. Basic stupid routines
1.1. Direct loading (file --> cm3d::World) O(N)
1.2. Direct saving (cm3d::World + metadata --> new file) O(N)

2. + convenience & perf
2.1. Updating (cm3d::World [+ metadata] --> file) max: O(N)
2.2. Parsing metadata (file --> metadata) O(M)
2.3. Changing metadata (metadata --> file) max: O(N), min: O(M)
2.4. Loading objects and modules partially, by ID (even without reading whole file) O(objsize) for each object

Keep in mind, all ID tables must be loaded before saving newly created objects
(those objects which are created after loading a file), to prevent ID conflict.
