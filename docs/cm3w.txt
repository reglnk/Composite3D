Composite3D World format

Glossary:
a.sz. = Applicable size
World = the class descried in <cm3d/Core/World.hpp>
Worldfile = the file used as a full binary representation of World and described here
UniqueStorage = the data structure described in <cm3d/Types/UniqueStorage.hpp>

The document includes:
- binary description of classes and structures related to World, required for (de)serialization to/from binary files;
- full specification and binary description of Worldfile and order of the above structures to be put in it;
- ways of processing data and importance of the data in each part of Worldfile.

The Worldfile has extension .cm3w in all applicable filesystems.
Each entire valid object of World class can be serialized into one Worldfile without loss of information,
and hence be deserialized from any valid Worldfile.

When (de)serializing, the key-value pairs of the following UniqueStorage fields cannot be rearranged (change key):
- World::objects
- World::sharedModules
(unlike pairs of cm3d::Object fields, which exist as UniqueStorage for convenient insertion and deletion only)

Following numeric descriptions are used as for C language. Types are from <stdint.h>.
Where applicable, binary structures layout is described with C language, but:
- considering that padding between structure elements is equal to 0;
- variable memory block are written as `type field[size]`, out of C standard, considering they are assigned a memory block of a.sz. and filled with applicable data from Worldfile or for writing to it.

The Tables, Modules & Objects don't require to be checked before loading certain data, nor require before saving data, unlike Header.
Positions of Objects and Modules may be mixed across their data block.

# Layouts =======================

struct Header
{
    char mark[4]; /* must equal to {'C', 'M', '3', 'W'} */
    uint32_t endianness; /* In hexadecimal, for LE: 71,d0,ee,f5 BE: f5,ee,d0,71
        So, the number 0xf5eed071 in selected endianness. Further, consider all numbers
        are in the same endianness. */

    uint32_t version; /* Unique version identifier of the format. The current document describes version number 0. */
    uint32_t blkMetaSize; /* Meta block size, from 1 byte to a.sz. */
    uint64_t blkObjMapSize; /* Size of objects mapping, from sizeof(uint64_t) to a.sz. */
    uint64_t blkSharedMapSize; /* Size of shared objects mapping, from sizeof(uint64_t) to a.sz. */
};

struct Metadata
{
    char worldName[a.sz.]; /* '\0' symbol is required. */
    char _remainingSpace[(blkMetaSize - sizeof(worldName)]; /* doesn't matter */
}

struct idLocData
{
    uint64_t id; // may be an allocated module ID or object ID
    uint64_t fileOffset;
};

struct objectLocations
{
    struct idLocData data[blkObjMapSize];

    /* doesn't matter */
    char remainingSpace[blkObjMapSize * sizeof(idLocData) - offsetof(objectLocations, remainingSpace)];
};

struct shrModulesLocations
{
    struct idLocData data[blkSharedMapSize];

    /* doesn't matter */
    char remainingSpace[blkSharedMapSize * sizeof(idLocData) - offsetof(shrModulesLocations, remainingSpace)];
};

struct Module
{
    uint64_t mSize;
    uint32_t mType;

    /* size: mSize; contents are defined by mType and the type of module itself. */
    char data[mSize];
};

struct Object
{
	uint32_t numModules;
    uint32_t numShrModules;
    uint64_t shrModulesIds[numShrModules];
    struct Module modules[numModules];
};

struct Worldfile
{
    struct Header header;
    struct Metadata meta;
    struct objectLocations objLocTable;
    struct shrModulesLocations shrModulesLocTable;

    /* the order of following data may be mixed and chaotic,
       while only maintaining integrity of each Object and Module, and following above tables */
	mixed {
		struct Object objects[];
		struct Module shrModules[];
		char remainingSpace[];
	} data;
};

ideas for next format:
1. add full object size to idLocData (uint64_t)
for optimization while reading directly from disk (partially)

for example:
'x' - the data which needs to be loaded
'.' - unneeded data
0----------------------------------------1--------2-------3-----4-------
[objLocTable][shrModulesLocTable]........xxxxxx.xxx.......xxxxxxx.......

So it would take only 2 calls of disk reading: for sections 1...2 and 3...4,
even if there're more than 2 objects (or shared modules).

2. btw it's possible to track all objects added to an IdMap since the last save
